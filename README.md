# ANN-Classification-Churn

Customer churn prediction using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** trained on bank-customer data, with a **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions.

---
## ✨ What this project does
- Trains an ANN model to predict whether a customer will **churn (exit)** or **stay**
- Saves the trained model (`model.h5`) plus preprocessing artifacts (encoders + scaler)
- Provides a Streamlit UI (`app.py`) where you enter customer details and get:
  - **Churn probability**
  - Final label: **Likely to churn / Not likely to churn**
